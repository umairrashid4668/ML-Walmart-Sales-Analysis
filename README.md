# Walmart Sales Forecasting

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting sales data for Walmart using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict future sales based on historical data, which includes multiple features such as sales, department, store information, and other related variables.

## 1. Data Exploration
The project begins with an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns, relationships, and distributions in the dataset.

## 2. Data Preprocessing
To ensure that the data is ready for machine learning models, the following preprocessing steps are performed:
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Transforming non-numeric data into numerical form for model compatibility.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating additional features that might improve the predictive power of the model.
- **Data Scaling**: Standardizing data to meet the assumptions of some algorithms and improve model performance.

## 3. Machine Learning Models
Multiple machine learning models are used to build predictive models:
- **Linear Regression**: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: A tree-based method that splits the data into branches to improve the prediction accuracy.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to provide a more accurate and robust prediction.

## 4. Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors.
- **R-squared (RÂ²) Score**: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
- **Accuracy Score**: Used for classification models to measure the number of correct predictions.

## 5. Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of different machine learning models for sales forecasting. Among the models used, the Random Forest Regressor generally provided the best performance in terms of accuracy and stability, highlighting its robustness for complex datasets with multiple variables. The findings suggest that advanced machine learning techniques can significantly improve sales prediction, which can be invaluable for optimizing inventory management and strategic planning in retail.
